#text
The lines starting with # as the first character on a line are called pragma
lines. They define how the content is to be inferred until the next pragma
appears. The pragma with a spoken language's name, at the beginning of the file
defines which language the rest of file is written in. The #english pragma
above is an example of it.

The #text pragma can be used to write prose, or comments, as we're doing here.
The #code pragma starts executable code
